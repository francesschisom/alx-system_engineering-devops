command_line_for_the_win
   STEPS I USED IN COMPLETING THIS PROJECT

1. I created the alx-system_engineering-devops repository on Github then I cloned it in my web terminal
2. I created the command_line_for_the_win directory and I also took some screenshots of my progress 
3. I established a SFTP connection with my sandbox then I used the put command line tool in SFTP to upload the screenshot of my project
4. I went ahead to git add,commit and push to my github account
